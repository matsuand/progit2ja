"What is \"`version control`\", and why should you care?\n"
"Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.\n"
"For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\n"

"If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use.\n"
"It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.\n"
"Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.\n"
"In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\n"

"Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they're clever).\n"

"It is easy to forget which directory you're in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don't mean to.\n"

"One of the most popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many computers today.\n"

"The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems.\n"
"To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed.\n"
"These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. (((CVS)))(((Subversion)))(((Perforce)))\n"

"This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs.\n"

"However, this setup also has some serious downsides.\n"
"The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents.\n"
"If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they're working on.\n"
"If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven't been kept, you lose absolutely everything -- the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines.\n"
"Local VCSs suffer from this same problem -- whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.\n"
